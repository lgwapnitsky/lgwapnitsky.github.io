After some playing around, some research, and plenty of time spent migrating articles (nothing is ever simple), I decided on the format that\u0026rsquo;s here.\nNow, there are things that are absent from this version that I liked in the other view, but I\u0026rsquo;m slowly learning how to adapt and make things look the way I want them to.

As of thge end of May 2025, I have become a licensed amateur radio (ham) operator, and a few weeks later, I upgraded my license to give me even more accessiblility.\nSo, why did I do this? Well, radio is one of those things that will always be available. That, and I needed a new hobby. So far, it\u0026rsquo;s been great, interacting with mostly local people over the airwaves, getting good tips on how to learn and advance. I\u0026rsquo;ve even managed to speak with some people who are remote via connected repeaters.\nThe long-term goal is to be able to connect using radio waves to people around the world, both via voice and digitally (yes, that\u0026rsquo;s possible). I plan (and we know how that goes) to write more about my ham escapades.\nIn conclusion\u0026hellip; # There are other things going on, but no real details to add just yet.

But, did you know that this wonderful dish has its origin in the Jewish delis of New York City?\nHistory # When the Irish immigrants started coming to the United States, they found that some of the foods they were used to back home were more expensive than they could afford. One in particular was what is called Irish bacon . The price of pork was considerably high for many immigrants, but there was something else they saw that was similar - the corned beef that was in the Jewish delis.\nBeef, at the time, was much less expensive, and the way it was cured was very similar to the methods used for Irish bacon. Seeing that there was a common thread between the two dishes, corned beef soon became a new staple in the Irish diet.\nSo, why the cabbage? Again, that was a cost effective vegetable that was cheap and easy to cook in one pot alongside the cured brisket. Combine the two and, voila, delicious tradition has started.\nSo, why am I telling you this? # I grew up with the delicious taste of corned beef from many delis, particularly the amazing style from Katz\u0026rsquo;s Delicatessen in New York City. My mom also used to make corned beef, usually around St. Patrick\u0026rsquo;s Day as well. So, I eventually started cooking this dish for my own family once I discovered a great recipe that uses my pressure cooker. I don\u0026rsquo;t buy a large one, but enough so that it gets devoured by the entire clan in one sitting (see below:)\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also cured my own corned beef in the past, and plan to do so again in the future once the cost of brisket comes down in price. It was nowhere near the level of Katz\u0026rsquo;s, but it was still an amazing tasting dish and worth the days of waiting! When that happens again, I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure to let you know.\nיום פטריק הקדוש שמח (Happy St. Patrick\u0026rsquo;s Day)\nReferences:\nThe Secret Jewish History of Corned Beef and Cabbage Corned Beef and Cabbage - More Jewish than Irish The Origins and History of Corned Beef and Cabbage ","date":"17 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cooking/corned-beef-cabbage-irish-staple-jewish-connection/","section":"What's Cooking?","summary":"The Irish staple with a Jewish connection.

It had been years since I had any semblance of a collection, but it was the COVID times, and I was bored. I picked up a decent record player, then started hunting the thrift stores and online. It was then that I found an interesting album cover, knew nothing about it, did no research, then found out from a friend that I had picked up a significant masterpiece in the history of digital music!\nThis album is what I found. The cover and title were intriguing, I\u0026rsquo;ve always enjoyed synthesizer music, and it only cost $1.\nNow, I could go into details about the history of Wendy (née Walter) Carlos , but there are so many resources online that tell her story. So why, then, am I writing this? Well, this album just blew me away. This album was released in 1968 and is so far ahead of its time! With the rise in synth music in the 80s, you would be mistaken in thinking this was created over a decade in the future of its actual release.\nDo I like this album? Obviously. Would I look for more? Well, I found the one below in another bargain bin, again for $1! Not only is this one just as good, in some ways it actually surpasses the other.\nI would love to share some samples of the music, but unfortunately, most of Carlos\u0026rsquo; music is not available for streaming , as she has not authorized its use. Fortunately, this Commodore 64 commercial from 1984 has her music in the background. You can also watch the movie \u0026lsquo;Tron\u0026rsquo;, as she did the soundtrack for that. If I wind up with more of her albums, I\u0026rsquo;ll let you know.

On one side, I\u0026rsquo;ve not been distracted by the apps (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and their high levels of noise.

Yes, this sounds whiny, but let me explain my thoughts as to why I\u0026rsquo;m not leaving it permanently.\nTiresome? How so? # I\u0026rsquo;ve been on social media on one aspect or another ever since I first got online in high school. BBSes, Prodigy boards, IRC, Usenet newsgroups, MySpace (briefly), Facebook, etc. As with anything, there are both good and bad experiences, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to concentrate mostly on Facebook for the pros and cons, and as for why I need a break.\nPros # When I was a runner, I found a few great communities through which I there was/is plenty of positive encouragement towards my goals. Additionally, I made a plethora of new acquaintances, a good number of whom have become friends.\nAs someone who does not run in large social circles, this was a great way of expanding relationships.\nIn my high school days, to say that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a large group of friends would probably be an understatement. It was a small school, and everyone pretty much knew each other, but I was hardly a popular person (in my view).\nUsing social media, I wound up reconnecting with many people whom I knew back in the day. Some of these connections have really shown me that we all missed out on what could have been better relationships back in the day, whereas others were great ways of getting back in touch with special people, (re-)forming new relationships as mature adults.\nThanks to social media, I\u0026rsquo;ve found other communities and events that have kept me busy over the past many years. I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered a more delinquent side to my already juvenile humor (and have been jokingly referred to as a reprobate), gone camping in locations I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about, and discovered restaurants and foods that were well off of my radar.\nI would definitely day that my cultural, culinary, and hobby horizons have all benefited from my years on social media.\nCons # The signal/noise ratio of ads to relevant content is just out of control. Most of my feed is full of junk that\u0026rsquo;s not even targeted properly, so seeing the content from those I\u0026rsquo;m interested in is sometimes tough to find, even in a timely fashion (I\u0026rsquo;ve seen stuff that was posted weeks earlier that might have meant something).\nWhen I do see the content from the people I\u0026rsquo;m interested in, it\u0026rsquo;s become a lot more content that no longer relates to me. Again, the signal/noise ratio. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in your local neighborhood squabbles 90% of the time. Maybe I just want to see what you and your family/friends are up to, something humorous and/or encouraging, or pics of your pets.\nPrivacy, privacy, privacy. I\u0026rsquo;ve put too much out there, and there are too many companies that are harvesting the information. Since I started using social media more regularly, the amount of spam in email and on my phone has increased. My name is out there, and I\u0026rsquo;m not too difficult to find. Any small step to reducing my social media footprint is important.\nTo say that I\u0026rsquo;m mentally exhausted from social media is an understatement. I dedicate too many brain cells to browsing and BS-ing, whereas I can spend my time better with other hobbies, such as reading, blogging, cooking, studying for my CDL and ham radio license, etc.\nWhy? # Without getting political, I feel that too many of the big technology companies are doing too much with what\u0026rsquo;s put out there. I\u0026rsquo;m not paranoid, nor am I a conspiracy theorist, but many years in technology have convinced me I need to slow down. This is a direct response to Con #4 above.\n\u0026ldquo;But aren\u0026rsquo;t you using a GitHub (a Microsoft-owned product) for your website and comments? They\u0026rsquo;re a big tech company!\u0026rdquo;\nShort answer: Yes. Long Answer: While all my experience over the years has moved me away from Microsoft in many aspects, GitHub remains an independent entity from the rest of the organization and maintains a commitment to Open Source.\nOK, so what kind of break? # I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to delete my accounts on many of the major platforms. What I am going to do is restrict my time and interactions. I believe there are apps out there that will assist with that (future blog post?). For people who want to interact with me, feel free to reach out via e-mail, phone call, or text.\nyI\u0026rsquo;d enjoy hearing about what you think of my decisions. Please comment below (yes, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to sign up with GitHub , but there are many worse things that you can do in life), or contact me directly.

After hearing from a number of people (my accountability group, friends and associates online), I decided to turn up the dial again, set some goals, and re-restart.\nFirst things first, my food intake. I let myself go near the end of 2020, thinking I could manage things myself. That did not work out well. I\u0026rsquo;m back to Intermittent Fasting using the Zero Fasting platform. I\u0026rsquo;m starting off slowly, with 16/8 split, with plans to eventually move back to 18/6. Right now, I usually hit 17 hours (or close to it) on a daily basis, and I\u0026rsquo;m trying to be better about the quality of the foods I eat. One thing I like about IF is that once I start my daily fast, there\u0026rsquo;s no room for snacking/desserts/etc. This takes will-power and control \u0026ndash; things I definitely need to work on.\nRegarding exercise, I\u0026rsquo;m using my \u0026ldquo;home gym\u0026rdquo; more. I\u0026rsquo;ve my bosu ball, two Swiss balls, two sets of elastic resistance bands. YouTube has been great for finding easy workouts for all this equipment. Some even combine the equipment so that I\u0026rsquo;m getting multiple benefits. The goal is to do these workouts at least 3 days a week.\nThen, there\u0026rsquo;s the dreadmill. I\u0026rsquo;m not running outside right now, even though I love the weather. I need to be able to stop as needed, so indoors is the best thing for me. Rather than just hop on and go for a random run, I\u0026rsquo;ve set a time/distance goal for June. Using the TrainAsOne app as my guide, workouts are generated for me for at least 3 days a week. They\u0026rsquo;re mostly shorter runs for now, but, hopefully, I will meet or exceed my goal (TBA) when the time comes.\nAs I mentioned, my accountability group has been great in pushing me forward. They helped me analyze some of what was going through my mind the last time I wrote. You can help be a part of my accountability by reaching out to me on Twitter , Telegram , or find me on other social media.\n","date":"22 January 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021/2021-01-22/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"The struggle bus has gotten back on the road, and I\u0026rsquo;m back in the game to work on my fitness levels - both physical and mental.

I\u0026rsquo;m telling you, I have a LOT of trouble leaving this place without browsing the snack aisle. This snack stuck out at me like a sore thumb due to the color of the bag (most of the surrounding ones were yellow).\nOne quick look at the ingredients on the back, and I knew I was set - this one had some nice flavors, including mango powder and asafoetida - one of my favorite Indian spices.\nThe actual snack was smaller than I expected, but boy, were these full of flavor. I can\u0026rsquo;t even begin to describe the wonderful melding of flavors that were now in my mouth. My buddy, the Musical Mathemetician, had a great description - \u0026ldquo;a simple chip, not overly complex, yet still brings a lot of flavor to the table.\u0026rdquo;\nWould I get these again? Probably, and I\u0026rsquo;d put them in a bowl to serve as a snack at a party.

Here, the snack aisles are stacked with boxes and boxes of chips, but these were highlighted on an end-cap. Ghost pepper? Don\u0026rsquo;t mind if I do!\nRight out of the bag, I knew these were going to have some kick. The smell was powerful of ghost peppers, and the heat was definitely there on my tongue. Was it hot? Yes, but not so much where I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stuff handfuls into my mouth and enjoy them. Then again, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a heat freak. There was no way anyone else in the family was going to try these, so I got to enjoy the whole bag myself.\nI\u0026rsquo;d consider these again, but they\u0026rsquo;re mostly a fad. Maybe if I had a bunch of people over who I knew enjoyed hot foods I\u0026rsquo;d pick them up, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go out of my way.\nNongshim Spicy Shrimp Crackers # Stop 3 - Asian Grocery #1. I love shrimp chips and shrimp crackers. I definitely go out of my way to enjoy them, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never noticed the spicy ones in the store. Once I saw these, there was no question they were going in my cart.\nI will not say these were a disappointment. They definitely tasted good. In fact, one of the better brands of shrimp crackers I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. Yet, the spice wasn\u0026rsquo;t really there. Yes, they had a VERY mild kick, but definitely not what I would call spicy.

Both lead down the road to improved overall wellness.\nTo say that this year started off a bit rough is an understatement. I\u0026rsquo;ve been dealing with a pinched nerve in my shoulder, which effects my right arm down to my hand. Thanks to the wonderful care of my chiropractor, it\u0026rsquo;s been improving significantly, but it\u0026rsquo;s still taking its time. This has affected my ability to work out using my arms. Considering most of my workout equipment (resistance bands, Bosu ball, Swiss balls) requires some use of the hands and arms, exercising has been short and painful.\nI did start hitting the dreadmill a bit again, as well. Due to increased weight and lack of consistent exercise over an extended period of time, I\u0026rsquo;m finding myself winded quicker over much shorter distances. In my short workouts, I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to break the .75 mile mark. This is a long stretch from the guy who \u0026ldquo;ran\u0026rdquo; a marathon in 2016.\nThese things combined with other issues (some related to the pandemic) have set me back a bit mentally. I\u0026rsquo;m finding lower motivation in my life to exercise. I\u0026rsquo;ve checked in with my accountability group, and they\u0026rsquo;re great at pushing me, but it\u0026rsquo;s when I push back that\u0026rsquo;s the problem. We\u0026rsquo;re all struggling in one way or another, so I know I\u0026rsquo;m not alone. I just need to start allowing their pushing to knock me down to the point where I want to get back up on my own.\nLike I said in the beginning, I\u0026rsquo;m going to be open about stuff, so here I am laying it out.

Use the blog as a \u0026ldquo;journal\u0026rdquo; of sorts? Possibly.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work ahead in order to regain the fitness I once had, much like my physical fitness. Will I ever be the same? Probably not. Can I be a better version of who I\u0026rsquo;ve been for the past year? Definitely.\nPersonal Growth \u0026amp; Education # I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll review my past goals and set some new ones here:\nThere are many cooking-related goals to review and set: Grilling and smoking - I learned to make pastrami this year. That was an adventure, and pretty darned delicious. Beyond that, I just smoked meats when I felt like it, but didn\u0026rsquo;t quite do enough. So, for 2021, the goal is to smoke more more meat AND to continue building my own smoker (soon to be written about in The Lab), which coincides with another goal for the year that will be mentioned below. https://www.instagram.com/p/CEudcFtHmGe Sous-vide and pickling went hand-in-hand, as I used my SV for pickling, as well as some delicious fish, scallops, and beautiful strip steaks. Again, the goal is to do more. The pressure cooker has been my go-to for a few years, now, and this year I really picked up on some new dishes that became family favorites - meatloaf \u0026amp; mashed potatoes, pork belly with shoyu eggs, and more. 2021 is the year of learning to bake in the pressure cooker. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried once with middling success. I REALLY want to make a cheesecake! Just keep cooking! It\u0026rsquo;s fun, I\u0026rsquo;m learning a lot, especially with baking AND the fact that my son is gluten-free, so adjusting for that has been an adventure in learning. Re-learn programming - why? Well, for one, I need it for my smoker. I\u0026rsquo;m combining a few projects and building a smoker out of a file-cabinet, then adding in a temperature regulated heater to manage the smoke temperature. As of writing this, I\u0026rsquo;m 75% done with the cabinet, and about 80% with the electronics. The latter is the tougher part. I managed to meet my Goodreads reading goal this year, with a few cheat books included that I read to my daughter. I don\u0026rsquo;t see an option for a 2021 challenge, but my plan is to either meet or exceed the 52 books completed in 2020.

I had a need for a lot of very specific ingredients for some cooking that I was going, so I schlepped to my local Indian market to grab what I needed. While wandering around, I stubmled into the snack aisle and became overwhelmed with the selection of interesting flavors. One type of flavor that always sticks out to me (and will become somewhat of a running theme) is hot and spicy. So when I saw bags upon bags of spicy snacks, I knew that I had to try something.\nAfter some browsing at the amazing selection, I decided on a bag of Tikha Ganthia. These are spicy little chickpea flour noodles. They looked like crunchy, curvy sticks of flavor, and I was sold.\nI opened the bag when I got home to have with lunch, and I knew that, from aroma alone, I was going to like these.

These are defintely not the snacks we\u0026rsquo;re used to here in the United States. The use of chickpea flour is also unique to my tastebuds for snacks. The crunch was subdued, but had the perfect amount of mouth-feel. The flavor, while spicy, was not overwhelming. Then again, I have a hot pallette and usually eat hotter than normal foods that my family doesn\u0026rsquo;t care for (bonus, these chips are now all mine).\nWould I buy these again? In a heartbeat.
