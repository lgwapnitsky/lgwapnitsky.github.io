One type of flavor that always sticks out to me (and will become somewhat of a running theme) is hot and spicy. So when I saw bags upon bags of spicy snacks, I knew that I had to try something. After some browsing at the amazing selection, I decided on a bag of Tikha Ganthia. These are spicy little chickpea flour noodles. They looked like crunchy, curvy sticks of flavor, and I was sold. I opened the bag when I got home to have with lunch, and I knew that, from aroma alone, I was going to like these. There was a warm spiciness that I’ve come to expect from good quality Indian food. I poured some into a bowl, and dug in. These are defintely not the snacks we’re used to here in the United States. The use of chickpea flour is also unique to my tastebuds for snacks. The crunch was subdued, but had the perfect amount of mouth-feel. The flavor, while spicy, was not overwhelming. Then again, I have a hot pallette and usually eat hotter than normal foods that my family doesn’t care for (bonus, these chips are now all mine). Would I buy these again? In a heartbeat.

That was an adventure, and pretty darned delicious. Beyond that, I just smoked meats when I felt like it, but didn’t quite do enough. So, for 2021, the goal is to smoke more more meat AND to continue building my own smoker (soon to be written about in The Lab), which coincides with another goal for the year that will be mentioned below. https://www.instagram.com/p/CEudcFtHmGe Sous-vide and pickling went hand-in-hand, as I used my SV for pickling, as well as some delicious fish, scallops, and beautiful strip steaks. Again, the goal is to do more. The pressure cooker has been my go-to for a few years, now, and this year I really picked up on some new dishes that became family favorites - meatloaf \u0026 mashed potatoes, pork belly with shoyu eggs, and more. 2021 is the year of learning to bake in the pressure cooker. I’ve tried once with middling success. I REALLY want to make a cheesecake! Just keep cooking! It’s fun, I’m learning a lot, especially with baking AND the fact that my son is gluten-free, so adjusting for that has been an adventure in learning. Re-learn programming - why? Well, for one, I need it for my smoker. I’m combining a few projects and building a smoker out of a file-cabinet, then adding in a temperature regulated heater to manage the smoke temperature. As of writing this, I’m 75% done with the cabinet, and about 80% with the electronics. The latter is the tougher part.

Yet, working out is something I need to do not only to help improve my phsyical fitness, but also my mental fitness. Both lead down the road to improved overall wellness. To say that this year started off a bit rough is an understatement. I’ve been dealing with a pinched nerve in my shoulder, which effects my right arm down to my hand. Thanks to the wonderful care of my chiropractor, it’s been improving significantly, but it’s still taking its time. This has affected my ability to work out using my arms. Considering most of my workout equipment (resistance bands, Bosu ball, Swiss balls) requires some use of the hands and arms, exercising has been short and painful. I did start hitting the dreadmill a bit again, as well. Due to increased weight and lack of consistent exercise over an extended period of time, I’m finding myself winded quicker over much shorter distances. In my short workouts, I’ve yet to break the .75 mile mark. This is a long stretch from the guy who “ran” a marathon in 2016. These things combined with other issues (some related to the pandemic) have set me back a bit mentally. I’m finding lower motivation in my life to exercise. I’ve checked in with my accountability group, and they’re great at pushing me, but it’s when I push back that’s the problem. We’re all struggling in one way or another, so I know I’m not alone.

Media outlets have been reporting on why to switch for weeks. But why? I, personally, have been using Telegram since about 2013, and have watched it grow. I’ve had friends join intermittently, and am slowly encouraging more to join, especially those who are using WhatsApp. Why? Security features (though some aren’t enabled by default) are a big component over regular social networks. Additionally, your data isn’t shared amongst multiple platforms, unlke WA, which shares with Facebook, Instagram, and any other Facebook-owned network. Telegram is nice in that you can create groups that function in similar ways to Facebook groups and/or messenger chats. You have the ability (with a little bit of work) to automate responses using “bots” (more on this in a future article). Looking at the bottom of my post, you can see that I’m even using Telegram for comments on my articles. Even though you use a phone number for a login, I never see that data. It is encrypted between you and the Telegram server. (I also have my site data encrypted using SSL, so there’s that layer of protection, too). This is only my simple, cursory overview of Telegram. There’s much more to learn about how it works. I’ll be sure to post more about those in the future, but the articles mentioned above have plenty of good information as well. As usual, feel free to comment below, or contact me on Telegram or Twitter.

After hearing from a number of people (my accountability group, friends and associates online), I decided to turn up the dial again, set some goals, and re-restart. First things first, my food intake. I let myself go near the end of 2020, thinking I could manage things myself. That did not work out well. I’m back to Intermittent Fasting using the Zero Fasting platform. I’m starting off slowly, with 16/8 split, with plans to eventually move back to 18/6. Right now, I usually hit 17 hours (or close to it) on a daily basis, and I’m trying to be better about the quality of the foods I eat. One thing I like about IF is that once I start my daily fast, there’s no room for snacking/desserts/etc. This takes will-power and control – things I definitely need to work on. Regarding exercise, I’m using my “home gym” more. I’ve my bosu ball, two Swiss balls, two sets of elastic resistance bands. YouTube has been great for finding easy workouts for all this equipment. Some even combine the equipment so that I’m getting multiple benefits. The goal is to do these workouts at least 3 days a week. Then, there’s the dreadmill. I’m not running outside right now, even though I love the weather. I need to be able to stop as needed, so indoors is the best thing for me. Rather than just hop on and go for a random run, I’ve set a time/distance goal for June. Using the TrainAsOne app as my guide, workouts are generated for me for at least 3 days a week. They’re mostly shorter runs for now, but, hopefully, I will meet or exceed my goal (TBA) when the time comes. As I mentioned, my accountability group has been great in pushing me forward. They helped me analyze some of what was going through my mind the last time I wrote. You can help be a part of my accountability by reaching out to me on Twitter, Telegram, or find me on other social media.

I’ve been dealing with a new injury which, in turn, has made it very tough for me to exercise. Combine that with my ongoing mental healing, I’ve not been eating well and have gained a bit of weight. Let’s just say I’m not happy with it. Add to that a blood test that shows that I need to be a bit more careful moving forward. The injury itself makes it very tough to sit at a computer and type for long periods of time. Even sitting in one position is painful after a while. I’ve been in PT for a few weeks and, even though I think my therapist is trying to kill me, there is definitely improvement. I’m hoping that the next few weeks show a significant increase in mobility and decrease in pain so that I can get back on the horse (or, in this case, the bike, for which I just purchased an indoor stand - more on that later). Thanks to friends and family with their support, I’m doing ok, and the road to wellness will be walked on again very soon. In the meantime, I’ve a few articles stashed away that I’ll be posting soon, so keep an eye out.

I’m not going to set time- or weight-specific goals, as those have caused me to struggle mentally in the past. What I DO want to do is lower my weight to a more healthy range and get my physical activity back up to a reasonable state so that I can be active without getting tired. All this combined starts today, January 4th, 2021 (well, actually last night). I began doing intermittent fasting again using Zero as my tracker and guide. I have my fitness apps all set to go, as well as videos I’ve made note of on YouTube. In addition, I’ve already spoken to the guys in my accountability group, and we’re all in this together. I believe that last part is what’s going to really push me through this year, as the intent is to really be accountable to each other. Today’s plan - continue my fast and get a little exercise and meditation in. If you plan to follow me on this journey, don’t expect the use of the word diet or specific mentions of actual body weight. What you can expect is to see updates on how I’m feeling mentally about the physical changes and (hopeful) improvements that are coming. Drop me a line on Twitter @lgwapnitsky with words of encouragement, inspiration, or if you want accountability. via GIPHY ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/posts/2021/2021-01-04-the-weight-is-over/:0:0","tags":["health","fitness"],"title":"The Weight Is Over...By A Lot","uri":"/posts/2021/2021-01-04-the-weight-is-over/"},{"categories":null,"content":"I know I said I’d post more, but there’s been a lot going on since my last post. It turns out that the injury I previously wrote about got worse. After seeing my excellent sports doctor, the diagnosis of my pinched nerve turned out to be a degrading disk in my neck, as shown by an MRI. The recommendation was to see a surgeon for a consult. Well, I did. The PA that came in first wanted to just have an epidural done. I let her know that steroids and I don’t really get along too well. The doctor came in, complimented me on my bushy beard saying, “That’s going to hide the surgery scar pretty well!”. Hence, we discussed an anterior cervical fusion on C5-C6. C4-C5 and C6-C7 are also degrading, but not as bad right now, so we’re minimizing the surgigcal procedure, which is scheduled for May 5th. I’m not looking forward to surgery, but at the same time, I am, as I want to be able to play with my kids, pick them up, exercise. This inactivity (save for some walking) and my bad diet have not been too good for me. Here’s hoping that all the pain goes away after a few weeks of recovery.
