        &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I started to collect vinyl albums. It had been years since I had any semblance of a collection, but it was the COVID times, and I was bored. I picked up a decent record player, then started hunting the thrift stores and online. It was then that I found an interesting album cover, knew nothing about it, did no research, then found out from a friend that I had picked up a significant masterpiece in the history of digital music!&lt;/p&gt;
