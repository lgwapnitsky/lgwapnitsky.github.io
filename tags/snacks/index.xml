      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite types of place to shop is ethnic supermarkets. I had a need for a lot of very specific ingredients for some cooking that I was going, so I schlepped to my local Indian market to grab what I needed. While wandering around, I stubmled into the snack aisle and became overwhelmed with the selection of interesting flavors. One type of flavor that always sticks out to me (and will become somewhat of a running theme) is hot and spicy. So when I saw bags upon bags of spicy snacks, I knew that I had to try something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A few trips to different markets and I &amp;lsquo;bagged&amp;rsquo; myself a few new snacks to try out. What did I get, and how did they taste?</description>
